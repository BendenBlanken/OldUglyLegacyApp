# OldUglyLegacyApp
The purpose of this application is for playing around with UI Flows.
The application mimics a contact form in a legacy system. After "saving" the form a unique identifier is generated which you can use as output.

The repo has a pre-build OldUglyLegacyApp.exe which you can use right away. For good measure I included the sources.
